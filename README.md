# ElTavo.Patterns

This repository is a collection of design pattern implementations in **C#**, organized into multiple projects. It serves as a reference for practicing and understanding different design patterns, following clean and modular design principles.

## Overview

Each project in this solution demonstrates a specific design pattern or a group of related concepts. The goal is to provide practical and well-structured examples of how to implement these patterns in real-world scenarios.

## Current Projects

### **Structural Patterns**
- **ElTavo.FacadePattern.Beneficios**: Demonstrates the Facade Pattern for managing employee benefits.
- **ElTavo.FacadePattern.ClienteFacturacion**: Implements the Facade Pattern for customer invoicing.
- **ElTavo.FacadePattern.Incentivos**: Illustrates incentives management with the Facade Pattern.
- **ElTavo.FacadePattern.Nomina**: A focused example on payroll handling using the Facade Pattern.
- **ElTavo.FacadePattern.Fachada**: Centralized facade logic combining various submodules for simplicity.

### **Behavioral Patterns**
- **Pattern.State**: Implements the State Pattern for managing object behavior based on its state.

### **Structural Patterns (Bridge)** 
- **Pattern.Bridge**: Demonstrates the Bridge Pattern to decouple an abstraction from its implementation.

### **Behavioral Patterns (Strategy)** 
- **Pattern.Strategy**: An implementation of the Strategy Pattern for interchangeable algorithms.
